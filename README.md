# Street Warriors

This is a simple 2D fighter game developed in Python using the Pygame library. Below, you'll find an overview of the code and its components.

## Game Overview

The game consists of a player character and an enemy character on a 2D platform. The player can control their character using the arrow keys to move and the spacebar to jump and attack the enemy. The objective is to defeat the enemy while avoiding its attacks.

## Code Structure

The game code is divided into multiple sections:

1. **Initialization**: Importing libraries, setting up Pygame, and defining constants.

2. **Player and Enemy Setup**: Initializing player and enemy characters, including their attributes such as position, health, and animations.

3. **Game States**: Defining game states (start, play, win) to control the flow of the game.

4. **Functions**: Various functions for rendering the game, handling player controls, and managing the enemy's behavior.

5. **Main Game Loop**: The main game loop where the game logic is executed continuously.

6. **Level 2**: Additional code for a level 2 start message (optional).

## How to Run the Game

To run the game, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have Python and Pygame installed on your system.

2. Place the required game assets (sprites, audio, etc.) in the appropriate directories as specified in the code.

3. Execute the main game file (`main.py`) to start the game.

4. Use the arrow keys to move, spacebar to jump, and 'V' key to attack the enemy.

5. Defeat the enemy and reach the win condition to complete the game.

## Additional Notes

- The game uses sprites for character animations and background images. Make sure to replace them with your custom sprites if desired.

- You can customize game attributes, enemy behavior, and win conditions by modifying the code.

- The code includes an optional level 2 start message. If not needed, you can remove or modify this section.
